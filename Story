I take a rip of the bong. Then I take eight more.
I feel the pulling at the back of my brain.
i feel everything zoom out and time slows.
Such a calm, euphoric feeling enters my body.
My thoughts are peacefully scattered, I am able to think now.
I'm feeling super creative today.
I'm wondering what should I doo doo doo doo.
Perhaps I will go out to get food, maybe I won't because that's too much work.
red, green, blue, purple and pink colors invade my vision. But I like it.
My body feels light and heavy, like my body is actually feeling happy.
